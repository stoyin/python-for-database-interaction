This repository explores how python interacts with a database using one of
its database libraries, "pymsql" among others like sqlite, mysql_connector,
pymongo, sqlalchemy etc.

pymsql is a library that enables python to interact with a database especially 
with MYSQL.This repository explores the benefit of pymsql library as it enables 
a python developer to embbed SQL quries into python functions.
 
Of course from the above introduction you need the following on your computer.
python3 with pymsql installed (you can use the pip command "pip install pymsql" from the 
command prompt). You will also need MSQL database sever installed and running on your 
cpmputer so you can see and experince the interaction between both environments.
Make sure you always check your MSQL environment after running each python program
to see corresponding changes.

Start with the files py_create_database.py and py_create_tables.py as they help you create 
a database and table in MSQL environment using pyhton.

pymsql (stage 1 - 4 ) examples explore python with basic MSQL queries, such as create, select, 
select with "where clause",insert, update.
pymsql(class 1) deals with the central purpose of pymsql which is to build a helper 
class to handle functions like select, insert, update and delete in an abstract format.
pymsql (class 2) has some modifications with additionl methods in the helper class.

Consequently in the future there is an intention to link this class with another application 
using the concept of "inheritance" in Object Oriented Programming and perhaps wrap it 
up with a web UI application using frameworks like flask or django.
